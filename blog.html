            Hello, Ben again.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align:center">It seems you've found me enjoying a bucket of
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cookie">cookies</a>.</p>

            <p>Currently, I'm a Ph.D. candidate in analytical chemistry at Iowa State University. Previously, I graduated from
            Concordia College, Moorhead in '21 with a B.A. in ACS Chemistry and a minor in math. At Concordia, I was a captain of
            the men's track and field team, and I threw shotput, discus, and hammer. I also did some chemistry tutoring and
            undergraduate research with HS-SPME-GC/MS of phthalate esters in local waters. </p>

            <p>In my free time I like to learn new things and work on fun coding projects. I think coding is really satisfying because it's like
            solving a puzzle that changes and grows as you attempt to make solutions. I'm inspired by the masses of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@tom7">programmers</a>
            and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@StuffMadeHere">engineers</a> on YouTube that make awesome things. I might try my hand at YouTube someday.</p>

            <p>I thought making this website would be fun to showcase different programming projects Iâ€™ve built and learn more about web design.
            My goal is to replicate â€œold internet" aesthetics- like that of Neocities and the personal websites in
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypnospace_Outlaw">Hypnospace Outlaw</a>.
            This website is an ongoing work in progress, so pardon my dust while the site is under construction.
            In the future, you might find some interesting quirks if you look carefully. </p>
            <p>Finally, I like to spend time with my friends and family, try delicious food, and play videogames.</p>
            <p> Uhh something else? I also enjoy sipping fine wine* and shredding** on my guitar...
            (See the included picture above***) </p>

            <p style = "color:#ffcc00">Disclaimers:</p>
            <p>*box wine</p>
            <p>**I'm only OK on guitar</p>
            <p>***That isn't a guitar, it's a bucket of cookies.</p>

                <h2>Get Pumped!</h2>
                <p>
                    This project was the automation of an experiment that involved lots of tedious pipeting. The control
                    of a few syringe pumps can remove this repetitive task from the experiment workflow. In this project,
                    I learned about interfacing hardware and software, utilizing serial connections, and multithreading.

                <h2>COUNT: Count objects until no tomorrow</h2>
                <p>
                    I like to look at cells under a microscope. I would like to count them, but they move, and there's
                    thousands of them... I wrote some code to track and count cells using OpenCV. This project is my first
                    foray into computer vision, and also includes a gui for increased accessibility. I learned a lot about
                    different image processing techniques and object detection algorithms. Building this was intense.

                <h2>This website</h2>
                <p>
                    I want to revive the style of personal sites from the good old days. This project is helping me learn
                    html, css, and javascript, and bad website design practices. I'm inspired by the aesthetic of the "old"
                    internet, and I try to emulate that here. This is an ongoing project, and in the future I plan on adding
                    some fun elements or easter eggs.

                <h2>The Perfect Grift</h2>
                <p>
                    Short-form content is a digital gold rush. I've automated production of TikToks using OpenCV and moviepy.
                    Originally, I wanted to make videos that seem like they would be a part of an <a class="project-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternate_reality_game">ARG</a> campaign- but these videos
                    performed extremely poorly. Since then, I've tried to optimize the videos to retain viewer impression,
                    but this also ends poorly.
                </p>

                <p>People don't want to watch 'ai-generated' or code generated slop. I can't remember my account credentials,
                but the accounts I made netted just around 100k impressions. Maybe someday I will return to this project to
                utilize API calls and modern AI image creation.</p>

         <h2>Intruder Detection System</h2>
            <p>
                Someone broke into my apartment and moved my vacuum. I used a Raspberry Pi and IR sensor to send alerts to my phone to stop the next intruder.
                I learned about working with APIs, software, and hardware.

            <p>No, the intruder didn't vacuum my floors.</p>

                <p>
                    One of my graduate projects involved making measurements on individual cancer cells. This gave me an
                    opportunity to learn about data analysis and transcend from excel. I learned pandas, numpy,
                    matplotlib/seaborn, and a lot of python.

                <h2>ImageJ Macros</h2>
                <p>
                    Some of the first code I've ever wrote was in the ImageJ macro language using notepad. I was interested in improving the
                    data analysis workflow for making measurements on fluorescence microscopy images. I wrote a series of macros
                    that automatically place regions of interest (ROIs) over regions of interest, identify the presence of cancer cells,
                    and made data collection easier.

                <h2>Starbattles</h2>
                <p>
                   Starbattles are a fun logic puzzle. The objective is to fill a grid of shapes with stars,
                    with a few simple limitations for how stars can be placed. I like <a class="project-link" href="https://www.puzzle-star-battle.com/stats.php?nick=starmonkey">solving these puzzles</a>,
                    so naturally (ambitiously/naively), I thought I'd try to get a computer to solve them for me. This
                    is the first project I've ever attempted.
                </p>
                <p>For some reason I used python's turtle graphics to create a game board that I could interact with. I
                can encode different boards and display them using the turtle graphics. I never got around to the solving
                heuristics, but having a program solve these puzzles is something I think about constantly. I'm very tempted to
                try and use rust for this problem.</p>

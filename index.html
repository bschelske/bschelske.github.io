        <p>ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to Ben's personal home page!</p>

        <p>
            I am a graduate student at Iowa State University studying for a PhD in analytical chemistry. My graduate research
            involves single-cell analysis and developing platforms for cancer detection. You can read more about
            my research <a href="https://anand.chem.iastate.edu/">here</a>. </p>

        <p>My research enabled me to gain experience in photolithography, BSL-2 lab work, and designing microfluidic devices.
        In graduate school, I also taught myself Python, Blender, COMSOL, and (a little) mandarin ä½ å¥½. Most of all, I learned
        how to become a professional problem solver and that I can learn anything I put my mind to.</p>


        <p>
            Outside of my graduate work, I am very interested in learning more about computer science and mathematics.
            I really enjoy <a href="my-projects.html">programming</a>, and you can learn more about me using the links above.
        </p>

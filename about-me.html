            Hello, I'm Ben.
        </p>

        <p>
            I am a graduate student at Iowa State University studying for a PhD in analytical chemistry. For the uninitiated, analytical chemistry concerns itself with quantifying small things. While my expertise is in analytical chemistry, my research is highly multidisciplinary, equipping me with a broad array of skills. From clean room photolithography and AutoCAD drafting to BSL-2 laboratory work—including cell culturing and blood fractionation—I've delved into diverse fields. My experience also extends to microfluidics, 3D modeling in Blender, data analysis, Python programming, and machine learning. This diverse skill set allows me to approach problems from multiple angles, often leading to innovative solutions. I’m particularly passionate about automating tedious tasks by leveraging these varied skills.

            Outside of my graduate work, I am very interested in learning more about computer science and mathematics. I taught myself Python and I really enjoy programming. Other than advancing my skills in python, I’m attempting to learn rust. I like the idea of having experience in both high and low level languages.

            I enjoy sipping fine wine and shredding on my guitar- though I am far from a rockstar sommelier.

            This website is a project of mine to showcase different programming projects I’ve built and learn more about web design. I’m inspired by the “old” internet aesthetic- things like Neocities and the personal websites in Hypnospace Outlaw. Initially, I designed this site with an intentionally jarring aesthetic for a bit of fun, but sometimes a bit of polish is needed. You might find some interesting quirks if you look carefully.
